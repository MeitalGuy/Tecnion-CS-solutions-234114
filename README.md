# Tecnion-CS-solutions-234114

To practice coding, I try to solve questions from the Technion's Intro to CS course, except I use Java instead of C.
I take the exams from here:
https://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/234114/Spring2018/ho_Previous%20Exams.html

I open a separate file for each exam, and every solution starts with the comment //qX, where X is the question number.
